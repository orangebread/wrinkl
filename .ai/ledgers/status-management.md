# Status Management

**Branch:** feat/status-management
**Summary:** Enhance feature status tracking with automated status updates, workflow transitions, and integration with git branches.
**Status:** Blocked
**Created:** 2025-06-25
**Updated:** 2025-06-25

## Context

### Problem Statement
Currently, feature status updates are manual and require editing the _active.md file or individual ledgers. Users want automated status tracking that integrates with their development workflow, including git branch status, commit activity, and pull request states. This would provide better visibility into actual feature progress.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Automated status detection based on git branch activity
- [ ] `wrinkl status` command to update feature statuses
- [ ] Integration with git hooks for automatic status updates
- [ ] Status workflow validation (e.g., can't go from Planning to Complete)
- [ ] Visual status dashboard with progress indicators

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `wrinkl status update feature-name --status "In Progress"` updates status
- [ ] Git branch creation automatically moves feature to "In Progress"
- [ ] Pull request creation moves feature to "Under Review"
- [ ] Status transitions follow defined workflow rules
- [ ] `wrinkl status` shows overview of all feature statuses

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
- Add status management system with workflow validation
- Create git integration layer for automatic status detection
- Implement status command with update and overview functionality
- Add status workflow configuration and validation

### Implementation Plan
1. **Status Workflow System**: Define valid status transitions and rules
2. **Git Integration**: Detect branch and PR status for automatic updates
3. **Status Command**: Create CLI commands for manual status management
4. **Workflow Validation**: Prevent invalid status transitions
5. **Dashboard Enhancement**: Improve _active.md with better status visualization

### Dependencies
- Git integration library (simple-git or native git commands)
- GitHub/GitLab API integration for PR status (optional)
- Enhanced file parsing for status extraction and updates
- Workflow validation system

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk 1**: Git integration might not work in all environments
  - *Mitigation*: Make git integration optional, fall back to manual updates
- **Risk 2**: Automatic status updates might conflict with manual updates
  - *Mitigation*: Add conflict detection and user confirmation for changes

## Progress Log

### 2025-06-25 - Initial Planning
- Created feature ledger
- Defined status workflow requirements
- Researched git integration options
- Identified dependency on configuration management feature

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Git Integration Approach
**Context**: Need to integrate with git without requiring complex setup  
**Options**: Git hooks, polling git status, or manual git commands  
**Decision**: Combination of git command integration with optional hooks  
**Reasoning**: Flexible approach that works in most environments  
**Consequences**: More complex implementation but better user experience

### Decision 2: Status Workflow Configuration
**Context**: Different teams might want different status workflows  
**Options**: Hardcoded workflow, configurable workflow, or no workflow  
**Decision**: Configurable workflow with sensible defaults  
**Reasoning**: Flexibility for different team processes while providing guidance  
**Consequences**: Requires configuration system (dependency on config-management)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Status workflow validation works correctly
- [ ] Git integration detects branch and PR status
- [ ] Status updates modify files correctly
- [ ] Workflow transitions are enforced properly

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end status management workflow
- [ ] Git integration works with real repositories
- [ ] Status command updates all relevant files
- [ ] Automatic status detection works reliably

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test status management in real development workflow
- [ ] Verify git integration with various git setups
- [ ] Test status dashboard visualization
- [ ] Validate workflow enforcement with edge cases

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Status management workflow documentation
- [ ] Git integration setup guide
- [ ] Status command reference
- [ ] Workflow customization examples

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- Git repository (optional for basic functionality)
- Git command line tools for integration features
- GitHub/GitLab access for PR integration (optional)

### Rollback Plan
Steps to rollback if issues are discovered:
1. Disable automatic status updates
2. Fall back to manual status management
3. Remove git integration features

## Review & Feedback

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Git integration is robust and handles edge cases
- [ ] Status workflow validation is comprehensive
- [ ] Automatic updates don't conflict with manual changes
- [ ] Performance is good even with large repositories
- [ ] Error handling covers git and file system issues

### Stakeholder Feedback
- Automatic status updates should be optional
- Status workflow should be customizable per team
- Integration with popular git hosting platforms is valuable

## Completion

### Final Status
- [ ] Status management system working reliably
- [ ] Git integration tested in various environments
- [ ] Workflow validation prevents invalid transitions
- [ ] Documentation covers all features and setup
- [ ] Performance tested with large repositories

### Lessons Learned
- Git integration complexity varies significantly across environments
- Workflow flexibility is important for team adoption
- Automatic updates need careful conflict resolution

### Follow-up Items
- [ ] Add integration with more git hosting platforms
- [ ] Create status reporting and analytics features
- [ ] Explore integration with project management tools
- [ ] Add status notification system
