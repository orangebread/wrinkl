# Feature Ledger: NPM Publishing Preparation

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Created:** 2025-06-25  
**Completed:** 2025-06-25  
**Assignee:** Jeff Lee (@orangebread)

## Overview

Prepare the wrinkl CLI tool for publishing to npm registry, including comprehensive testing, packaging fixes, tooling improvements, and documentation updates.

## Problem Statement

Before publishing to npm, need to ensure:
- Package is properly configured and tested
- All essential files are included in the published package
- Modern tooling is in place for maintainability
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- Multi-package manager support for broad adoption

## Goals

### Primary Goals
- ✅ Fix critical packaging issues (template files were being excluded)
- ✅ Migrate to modern tooling (Biome for linting/formatting)
- ✅ Add multi-package manager support (npm, pnpm, yarn)
- ✅ Update documentation with installation instructions
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ All tests pass (73/73 tests passing)
- ✅ Package includes all necessary files for runtime
- ✅ Modern linting and formatting with Biome
- ✅ Auto-detection of user's package manager
- ✅ Clean git history with logical commits
- ✅ Ready for `npm publish`

## Technical Approach

### 1. Tooling Migration
- **From:** ESLint + manual formatting
- **To:** Biome (all-in-one linting + formatting)
- **Benefits:** 10-100x faster, native ES module support, modern defaults

### 2. Package Manager Support
- **Detection Logic:** Check lock files → package.json → environment variables
- **Supported PMs:** npm, pnpm, yarn with appropriate commands
- **User Experience:** Auto-detection with helpful tips

### 3. Packaging Fixes
- **Issue:** Templates were excluded by .npmignore
- **Fix:** Remove template exclusion, add dev tools to ignore
- **Validation:** Test with `npm publish --dry-run`

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated scripts, removed ESLint, added Biome
- `biome.json` - New configuration for linting and formatting
- `.npmignore` - Fixed to include templates, exclude dev tools
- `README.md` - Added multi-package manager installation instructions
- `src/utils/package-manager.js` - New utility for PM detection
- `src/commands/init.js` - Added PM-specific tips
- `src/index.js` - Export new package manager utilities

### Key Commits
1. **feat: migrate from ESLint to Biome** - Modern tooling migration
2. **feat: add multi-package manager support** - npm/pnpm/yarn support
3. **fix: improve npm packaging and update documentation** - Critical fixes

## Testing & Validation

### Automated Testing
- ✅ All 73 tests passing
- ✅ Biome linting with only minor complexity warnings
- ✅ Package manager detection working correctly

### Manual Testing
- ✅ `npm publish --dry-run` successful
- ✅ Template files included in package
- ✅ CLI functionality tested in clean environment
- ✅ Package manager detection tested with pnpm

## Outcomes

### What Worked Well
- **Biome migration** - Seamless transition with immediate benefits
- **Package manager detection** - Robust fallback logic works reliably
- **Comprehensive testing** - Caught critical packaging issue early

### Lessons Learned
- **npm packaging is tricky** - .npmignore overrides package.json files array
- **Template files are critical** - Would cause runtime failures if excluded
- **Modern tooling pays off** - Biome is significantly faster and easier

### Metrics
- **Package size:** 22.8 kB (reasonable for CLI tool)
- **Dependencies:** Reduced by 64 packages (ESLint removal)
- **Test coverage:** Maintained >80% coverage
- **Performance:** 10-100x faster linting with Biome

## Next Steps

1. **Publish to npm** - Ready for `npm publish`
2. **Monitor adoption** - Track downloads and user feedback
3. **Iterate based on feedback** - Address any issues that arise
4. **Continue feature development** - Move to next priority features

- **Multi-Package Manager Support** - Core capability for broad adoption
- **Modern Tooling** - Foundation for maintainable development
- **Export Functionality** - Next major feature to implement

**Final Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for npm publishing
**Quality Gate:** All tests passing, packaging validated, documentation complete
