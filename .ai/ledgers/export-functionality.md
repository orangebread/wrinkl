# Export Functionality

**Branch:** feat/export-functionality
**Summary:** Add ability to export AI context and feature ledgers in various formats for sharing, backup, and integration with other tools.
**Status:** Up Next
**Created:** 2025-06-25
**Updated:** 2025-06-25

## Context

### Problem Statement
Users need to share their AI context and feature documentation with team members, stakeholders, or other tools. Currently, the only way to share context is by copying the entire `.ai/` directory. Users want to export context in formats like PDF, HTML, or consolidated Markdown for presentations, documentation sites, or backup purposes.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Export entire AI context as single consolidated document
- [ ] Support multiple output formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
- [ ] Include or exclude specific sections (active vs archived features)
- [ ] Generate table of contents and cross-references
- [ ] Maintain formatting and structure in exported documents

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `wrinkl export --format html --output docs/` creates HTML documentation
- [ ] `wrinkl export --format pdf --file project-context.pdf` creates PDF
- [ ] `wrinkl export --include active --exclude archived` filters content
- [ ] Exported documents include navigation and are well-formatted
- [ ] Export preserves markdown formatting and code blocks

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Changes
- Add new export command with format-specific processors
- Create document consolidation system that merges AI context files
- Implement format converters for HTML, PDF, and enhanced Markdown
- Add filtering system for selective content export

### Implementation Plan
1. **Export Command**: Create `wrinkl export` command with format options
2. **Content Aggregation**: Build system to collect and merge AI context files
3. **Format Processors**: Implement HTML, PDF, and Markdown processors
4. **Filtering System**: Add include/exclude options for selective export
5. **Template System**: Create export templates for consistent formatting

### Dependencies
- Markdown-to-HTML converter (marked or similar)
- PDF generation library (puppeteer or similar)
- Template engine for export formatting
- File system utilities for content aggregation

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk 1**: PDF generation might be complex and add significant dependencies
  - *Mitigation*: Make PDF optional, focus on HTML first, consider headless browser approach
- **Risk 2**: Large projects might create unwieldy exported documents
  - *Mitigation*: Add pagination, section splitting, and filtering options

## Progress Log

### 2025-06-25 - Initial Planning
- Created feature ledger
- Researched export format options and libraries
- Defined content aggregation strategy
- Outlined filtering and template system

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Export Format Priority
**Context**: Multiple formats requested but need to prioritize development  
**Options**: HTML first, PDF first, or Markdown first  
**Decision**: HTML first, then enhanced Markdown, PDF as optional  
**Reasoning**: HTML is most versatile and easier to implement well  
**Consequences**: Users get useful export quickly, PDF can be added later

### Decision 2: PDF Generation Approach
**Context**: PDF generation can be complex with many library options  
**Options**: Dedicated PDF library, HTML-to-PDF, or external tool integration  
**Decision**: HTML-to-PDF using headless browser (puppeteer)  
**Reasoning**: Reuses HTML formatting, handles complex layouts well  
**Consequences**: Larger dependency but better output quality

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Content aggregation collects all relevant files
- [ ] Format processors generate valid output
- [ ] Filtering system includes/excludes content correctly
- [ ] Template rendering works with various content structures

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full export process works end-to-end for each format
- [ ] Exported documents are well-formatted and complete
- [ ] Large projects export without memory issues
- [ ] Export works with custom templates and configurations

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Export various project sizes and verify output quality
- [ ] Test all format options and filtering combinations
- [ ] Verify exported documents are usable and well-formatted
- [ ] Test export performance with large feature sets

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Export command documentation with all options
- [ ] Examples for different export scenarios
- [ ] Template customization guide for export formats
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for export issues

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Requirements
- Optional dependencies for PDF generation (puppeteer)
- Sufficient disk space for temporary export files
- Memory considerations for large project exports

### Rollback Plan
Steps to rollback if issues are discovered:
1. Disable export command
2. Remove export dependencies
3. Fall back to manual file copying

## Review & Feedback

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Export process is efficient and handles large projects
- [ ] Generated documents are well-formatted and complete
- [ ] Error handling covers file system and format conversion issues
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable for large exports
- [ ] Export templates are flexible and customizable

### Stakeholder Feedback
- HTML export should be mobile-friendly and printable
- PDF export should include bookmarks and navigation
- Consider export scheduling for automated documentation

## Completion

### Final Status
- [ ] All export formats working correctly
- [ ] Performance tested with large projects
- [ ] Documentation complete with examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Export templates tested and refined

### Lessons Learned
- Export quality is more important than format variety
- Template flexibility enables many use cases
- Performance considerations are crucial for large projects

### Follow-up Items
- [ ] Add export scheduling/automation features
- [ ] Create export template gallery
- [ ] Integrate with documentation hosting platforms
- [ ] Add export analytics and usage tracking
